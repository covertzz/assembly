Dear Director Bee,

Here is our comprehensive budget report for Q4 2022.

The pollen box is partially down. This includes its services of ldap, and ssh, and we are finding solutions to these problems. The dns service was down for about 45 minutes but it is fully functioning once again. 

Our honey box has been fully functional for the full duration. This includes the http and ssh services. A full LAMP stack has been configured on it as well.

Finally the wax box is working partially. The sql service has been down and we are doing our best to find the solution. Ssh for wax is fully up and running. 

This concludes our budget report.

Sincerely,
Admin Bee
